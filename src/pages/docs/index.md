# Getting Started

**TexLab** is a cross-platform implementation of the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) for the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) typesetting system.

## Requirements

In order to start the server, you will need to install:

- A [TeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get/#tex-distributions) of choice.
- A [Java 8](https://java.com/en/download) (or later) runtime environment.

> **Note**: Please make sure that both dependencies are in your `PATH` environment variable.
